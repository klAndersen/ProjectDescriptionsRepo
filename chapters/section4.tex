In the two Java courses in my Bachelor, we had the same assignment, but with different requirements. 
The main focus was to register two different animals (hares and lynx). 
Common for both was the registration of their gender (male/female), length (Double), weight (Double), time of capture (day, month, year) and location (String). 
The ID was to be incremented, and start with the initial for the given animal (e.g. L1, L2, \ldots, H1, H2, \ldots). 
For the hares, colour (String) and type (Char) was to be registered. 
For the lynx, the length of their ears (Double).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
If an animal was later re-captured, their data should be updated instead of re-registered. 
The program had the possibility to search for animals based on ID, show amounts of re-captures (based on the entered year), 
show amount of different hare captures (based on type), and an unsorted report of all first-time captures.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The first course was introductory level, so input/output was shown in command line, and data was stored in a text file. 
In the second course, the user was presented with a GUI that we had to code ourselves (not use a Designer), and the data was stored in a MySQL Database 
(using JDBC as database driver). 
Singleton was used to ensure that there was only one object maintaing the database connection. 
The main menu used JFrame, and the child windows used JDialog.

This was an introductory course to developing applications for Android. 

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 1} ~\\
The task was to develop a conversion app for different measure systems (distance, volume, mass, temperature and time).
When starting the application, the user begins by selecting the measurement category, unit to be converted and then enters the numerical value.
A requirement included the use of Fragments, since the application should be able to run on devices with small and large screens, and also multilingual (Norwegian and English).

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 2} ~\\
The task was to develop two different applications (application A and application B).
Application A could be used to manage information about books/book titles, which was stored in a text file. 
Application A should at least contain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Start-up activity functioning as a menu to access other activities.
	\item An Activity that displays a list of all registered titles.
	The user can then choose a book title and this should then be returned.
	\item An Activity that registers a new book title, and stores this in the file.
	\item An Activity that allows deletion of selected book title.
\end{itemize}
% space for readability
The activities created added in application A were then to be used by application B (e.g. title selection (which is returned from A to B), adding new titles, etc.).
For each new title added, a broadcast is sent from application A, which is to be caught by application B and displayed in a Toast.

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 3} ~\\
The task was to develop two Android applications, one that logs and stores information about various "events" and one that serves as an interface to the log.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
Application 1: Event Logs \\
This application could (by using a BroadcastReceiver) capture and store information from system events (e.g. receiving SMS, phone calls, GPS turned on/off, WiFi turned on/off, etc.). 
Each event had its own category (e.g. Telephony, Network, Positioning, etc.), and stored it in a \getprefix{sqlite} database (which was "exposable" via Content Provider).
The stored data for all events are date, time, category, text, details (parameters/values associated with the event, e.g. who the SMS came from).
When the application is started, the user could see a "Setting" activity that allowed the user to decide what events to log.
When a broadcast occured, the BroadcastReceiver would start and store the relevant information in the database (the application did not have to be started for this to work).
\clearpage\noindent
Application 2: LoggerUI \\
This application displayed the information that was stored in the database by Application 1 (by using ContentResolver).
The user could then select a category and display all events for the given category.

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 4} ~\\
The task was to develop a temperature monitor and notification application for Android, where data was downloaded from a weather website as \getprefix{xml}. 
The data was downloaded by using a Service (which also handled the \getprefix{xml}-parsing), that started when the device started.
The service could also be started/stopped through the applications ActionBar, but unless stopped, the service continued running after the application was exited.
The temperature data was measured by various weather stations, where each weather station have a unique number and name (e.g. '84700', 'Narvik airport'), but they can have the same URL. 
In addition to extracting the temperature, the weather station data was also needed so that users could select which weather stations they wanted to monitor.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
In the application, the user could select between getting a list showing monitored weather stations, adding new weather stations for monitoring, and displaying application settings. 
For the list of monitored stations, the weather station number, name and last monitored temperature was displayed (and also had the possibility to remove selected station(s)).
In the Settings, users could set download interval (e.g. every hour, every two hours, every three hours, etc.) and temperature range (upper/lower limit).
After temperature data was downloaded and extracted, if the temperature for any given station was above/below set limit, a notification was given to the user.

\subsubsection{TracknHide}
\label{sec:tracknhide}
This project was part of the course grade, and consisted of developing an application that could show the different users location and route on a map. 
The project had two parts, an Android application and a Java web server.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The Android application used Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to send and receive data, and Google Maps (API v1) to present a map. 
By using MapOverlay, users could also show the adress when clicking a location on the map, and switch between Street â€“ and SateliteView. 
On the map, the route and current position of logged in users with shared position was shown. 
Users could also choose to store their own or others route, which could later then be re-drawn on the map. 
The position data was retrieved by using the devices GPS, but the amount of position data sent was set by the user (amount of time passed or distance moved).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The Java Web server was created using HTML, Java Servlets and JSP, running on Apache TomCat v7.0. 
It stored the user related information in a MySQL Database, and kept track over all the currently logged in users. 
The web pages was mainly targeted at an administrator, to give them the ability to view connected users, and disconnect if needed. 
The server was also the connection point for the users to share/receive position data and notifications via GCM.

In this course I tried to develop an indoor tracking prototype app for Android. 
The purpose was to be able to locate teachers and professors on campus, by measuring the WiFi-signals at their current location 
(if they had enabled/allowed tracking of their current location).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The server side of the application was developed using PHP (because the college server only ran PHP), which mainly handled data transfer between the Android app and the MySQL database.
When data from the database was needed, the server retrieved the data, added it to an array as JSON and printed it as HTML. 
This HTML was then converted to a JSONArray on the mobile device (as I stated in my report, it would probably have been much easier if one could have used Java Servlets, 
since one could overwrite the HTTP GET/POST methods).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
To get test data, I went to different buildings, rooms and floors spread out on campus (20 rooms, signals measured in all 4 corners plus the middle of the room). 
What I found when looking at the gathered data was that the measurement for the WiFi-signal was set too low (value=5). 
Therefore this prototype was not finished, as I did not have the time to re-measure all the rooms to get more accurate signal data.

When nearing the end of my Bachelor degree, I wanted to know what my average grade was, to see what colleges and universities I could apply to in regards to taking a Master degree. 
This lead to the development of "BeregnSnitt". 
BeregnSnitt calculates the average score based on the grades and total points the user has.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The user is presented with a GUI (Jframe and Jdialog), where s/he can enter the amount of A to E's achieved, the course points and the total points achieved (e.g. Bachelor = 180). 
I also added the possibility to add additional course grades, in case some courses varied (e.g. if the standard was 10, but one course had 3 points, another 5, etc.).

% TODO: Re-view and re-write this
This was a program I started on after learning Android. 
The reason I started working on it was because one often gets text messages or calls when you cannot reply or answer.Â 
Sometimes, people continue to text or call, and I therefore started working on what I call an Auto-reply app. 
The auto-reply is sent out as a text message (SMS), which could either be random or a set topic.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The auto-reply could be sent to only to those marked for it, or apply to all in the phones contact list. 
The auto-reply was restricted by a delay, adjustable through the settings. 
When a call or SMS came in,Â if the person calling/texting was on the Auto-reply list, a timer would start. 
When the timer ran out, a check would occur to see if the SMS/lost call was unread. If so, a SMS would be sent out. 
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
TheÂ SMS that were sent from the Auto-reply are random, but that was mostly because I created it for myself. 
I planned to later add some Machine Learning logic to it, so that it could reply somewhat intelligentlyÂ to the SMS, instead of a random text.
