This project was the exam-case in this course, which counted for 60\% of the final course grade. 
The project was  based on developing an application for course evaluation.
Included in the exam-case was models of the database, and a SQL script that contained some data, with a set user-account (which were to be used for database connection(s)).
The system had have two main parts; one for teachers and the other for students. 
In the teachers part, there was a management section (for questionnaire creation), and a report stage for statistics related to the students answers.
The part for the students\footnote{
	We divided our group into two (we were in total six people), where our "half" worked on the teacher part. 
	Therefore, the main task description for the Student part is omitted from this section.
} was mainly targeted at giving access only to students taking the course, and giving them the ability to answer and submit the evaluation.
Student information was retrieved electronically from the student system\footnote{
	The student system contained data about which student was taking a given course (where "course" is a subject/course taught a given semester; e.g. INF110 S07).
	Retrieving student data from the student system was not a part of this project, but just information given in the exam-case description.
}.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
For each evaluation, a number of questions where made available, where each question should give between two to five answer options.
It is up to the teacher to determine which details are relevant for a given evaluation (an evaluation includes the course, evaluation name, created questions and answer alternatives).
There were two dates that needed to be set, evalDateOut and evalDateIn, which specifies the time for when the evaluation was available for students. 
The teacher should be able to change the questions and answers, but not after the first student has completed the evaluation.
A course can have multiple evaluations, and this may overlap in time. 
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
For the report section, the teacher should be able to see answer distribution for each question. 
It should also be possible to know who has completed the evaluation (since some evaluations could be mandatory).
There should be an opportunity to "export" the counted data for a specific evaluation to a flat file, which then could be imported into Excel. 
The teacher should also be able to delete all student responses for an evaluation (when it is finished).

Storenuten Høgfjellshotel is a mountain hotel with an excellent location in the Norwegian mountains. 
Aside from their own family-friendly resorts, the hotel has responsibility for maintaining 130 km ski slopes in the surrounding areas.
It is a short distance to the municipals newly established state of the art resorts.
Høyfjellshotell has since the 50s evolved from a small family business to now being a major employer in the county with people. 
The hotel is newly renovated and has all the rights. 
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The hotel has 130 modern double rooms and 35 family rooms with 4 beds, with the possibility of an extra bed. 
When it comes to stay in double or family, the price includes full board (breakfast, lunch and dinner; beverages for lunch and dinner are not included). 
The price is per date 1020 kr for an adult per day, and it is half price for children under 16 years. 
The hotel writes expenses to the room (the guest fills out receipt with room number; expenses can be drinks, mini-bar, etc.), which is then settled at check-out.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
After market entry of the ski resort, the mountain hotel has experienced strong growth in its business.
They now have an urgent need for a new system to handle their hotel operations. 
In the first round, it is important that the new system handles the work of managing orders, check-in and stay ("expenses are recognized in the room during the stay") and check-out.
On the basis of the information at any time in the system will be possible to take out information of a financial nature.

\subsubsection{Space Invaders}
\label{sec:space_invaders}
A scroll-game like space invaders, where the player controls a space-ship. 
The topic for the development was chosen by the group. 
A short scenario context is that the player is a farmer kidnapped by aliens, and have to save the Earth (and his harvest).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
I handled the design and development of the enemies, game settings and playing sound/music. 
The game contained up to six levels, where the player could select which to play (but level 2-6 had to be opened first by completing previous level. 
The player got points for destroying enemies (asteroids and aliens). 
After two minutes of play, the boss appeared. 
The game also contained a "Top 10" list displaying the scores for the players.

\subsubsection{Tower of Knowlegde}
\label{sec:tower_of_knowledge}
Tower defence game meets quiz where the goal is to attack only the wrong answers. 
The topic was selected by the group. 
The player can put out none or more towers, and the player had to let the "correct" answer only pass.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
Answers was shot by clicking the answer, presuming it was within the given towers range. 
Points were given for attacking enemies, and reduced for each answer passing the goal. 
The player was not told if the answer was correct until the game had ended, and when the game was over, the player was added to the Top 10 list presuming their score was high enough. 
My responsibilities in this project was the development of the main menu, reading (questions, answers, Top 10) and writing (Top 10) to file, sound/music.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
In addition, I also created a small program for the creation of questions and answers (since the variables was read from file using URLVariables), which was written in \getprefix{csharp}.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
Example of file content: \\
\textit{qst=question1?,question2?\&alt=alt1,alt2\&ans=ans1,ans2}

% TODO: Re-view and re-write this
This course was based on learning how to create 3D-models and how to work with a 3D-modeling tool (\getprefix{3dsm}). 
This was a purely introductory course, so I cannot claim to have any expertise after this course, other than a general understanding.

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 1-2} ~\\
In the first two assignments, the task was to create a sketch of a vehicle (I sketched a car), and create textures based on taking  and editing images of clothing, carpets, etc. 

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 3} ~\\
The task was to model a Lego block, which should look as realistic as possible. 
Instead of the text "Lego", our own name was to be added on the one side. 
It also contained texture, to resemble reality. 

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 4} ~\\
The task was to create a vehicle based on the sketch from \getprefix{ass} 1. 
The vehicle was to be modeled in such a way that it could be animated later (in regards to wheels, belts, bone, course change, etc.).

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 5} ~\\
The task was to model a "race cart/vehicle trail/stadium" for the vehicle to drive on, with tribune and facilities.
We also had to take scaling into consideration, in regards to the vehicle. 

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 6} ~\\
The task was to create an avatar model of ourselves, based on pictures of ourselves.
The scaling was the same as that for the vehicle in \getprefix{ass} 4, since the avatar had to "fit" the size of the vehicle.

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 7} ~\\
Based on the avatar created in \getprefix{ass} 6, the task was to rig it with a skeleton. 
This was done using the "bones" and then modifying the "skin", followed by adjusting the "envelope" of the individual members/bones.
This was to ensure that the skeleton motion moved the right parts of the figure.
The skeleton also had arms and foot-triggers, and had a short animation of a fall by using Inverse Kinematics (IK).

\paragraph{\getprefix{ass} 8} ~\\
This task focused on lighting, where the goal was to simulate "evening sun", without using plugins or taking advantage of the "Daylight System".
There were also camera usage, that showed a short animation of the vehicle (\getprefix{ass} 4) driving around on the stadium (\getprefix{ass} 5).
