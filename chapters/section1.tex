This document lists all the development projects I have been a part of, starting from my Bachelors degree until my completed Masters degree in Applied Computer Science. 
Each section is dedicated to a given programming language, the exceptions are the two last sections, Section \ref{sec:section6} and \ref{sec:section7}.
Projects uploaded to GitHub will also contain a link to its given repository, but group projects is not listed.
For all projects, there will be a listing for project type (\getprefix{ass} or \getprefix{priv}), \getprefix{ide} and \getprefix{progLang} that were used. 
Development projects from courses will also include the \getprefix{college}, the \getprefix{level} (\getprefix{bach} or \getprefix{master}) and the \getprefix{course} it belongs to.
