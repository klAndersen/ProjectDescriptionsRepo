A two-part group project, where the first part was the teacher system and the second the system for the students.
I was part of the group working with the teacher system (we were 3 people working on this), where the system should be able to create new questions for a given course, 
and set parameters for the evaluation. 
The teacher would need to get a statistical overview of students answers, and also be able to export/store these to a file. 
The tools used were Visual Studio IDE, Visual Basic as programming language (course requirement), and MySQL as database. 
The GUI was Windows Forms.

This was a group project in a system development course. 
The task was to develop a system for hotel management, where the user should be able to check-in/out guests, see available rooms, room expenses and retrieve economical reports.
The system was created by using Microsoft Access and MySQL as database. Microsoft Visio was used to create DataFlow Diagrams.

\subsubsection{Space Invaders}
\label{sec:space_invaders}
% TODO: Re-view and re-write this
A scroll-game like space invaders, where the player controls a space-ship. 
This was developed in Flash, using ActionScript 3 as scripting language. 
The topic for the development was chosen by the group. 
A short scenario context is that the player is a farmer kidnapped by aliens, and have to save the Earth (and his harvest).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
I handled the design and development of the enemies, game settings and playing sound/music. 
The game contained up to six levels, where the player could select which to play (but level 2-6 had to be opened first by completing previous level. 
The player got points for destroying enemies (asteroids and aliens). 
After two minutes of play, the boss appeared. 
The game also contained a "Top 10" list displaying the scores for the players.

\subsubsection{Tower of Knowlegde}
\label{sec:tower_of_knowledge}
% TODO: Re-view and re-write this
Tower defence game meets quiz where the goal is to attack only the wrong answers. 
The topic was selected by the group. 
The player can put out none or more towers, and the player had to let the "correct" answer only pass.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
Answers was shot by clicking the answer, presuming it was within the given towers range. 
Points were given for attacking enemies, and reduced for each answer passing the goal. 
The player was not told if the answer was correct until the game had ended, and when the game was over, the player was added to the Top 10 list presuming their score was high enough. 
My responsibilities in this project was the development of the main menu, reading (questions, answers, Top 10) and writing (Top 10) to file, sound/music.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The game was developed using Flash and ActionScript. The IDE was Adobe Flash CS 4 and FlashDevelop (actionscript). 
In addition, I also created a small program for the creation of questions and answers (since the variables was read from file using URLVariables), which was written in Visual Studio, C\#.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
This is how the file content looked like:
\textit{qst=question1?,question2?\&alt=alt1,alt2\&ans=ans1,ans2}

This course was based on learning how to create 3D-models and how to work with a 3D-modeling tool, namely 3DS MAX. 
This was a purely introductory course, so I cannot claim to have any expertise after this course, other than a general understanding.
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
In the first two assignments, we were asked to create a sketch of a car, and create textures based on taking images of clothing, carpets, etc. 
The next four assignments were based on creating various models (a Lego block with our name on it using the texture we created), a car, 
a stadium for the car to drive on and a character representation of ourselves).
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
The last two assignments covered Skeletal movement (making the character able to move, and give it a short animation) and lighting 
(we had to simulate "evening sun" without using plug-ins or "daylight system").
\vspace{0.5em}\newline
I also had a course in Game Design, where we used UDK and Unreal to model a game world (the code was written using Unreal Script).

% TODO: Taken from the original task description
task1 \\
The task is to model a Duplokloss (with 8 buds on top). 
It should look something like the following figures. 
See also the web for pictures of bricks to get the appropriate details. 
Like the real blocks is important. In my models depicted below, there are some shortcomings and you can do better. 
On the one hand should your name be in attendance for "Lego" that I have put on my.
---
Add an appropriate texture for the group as block appears authentic. 
Add in simple colors / textures that resemble blocks of reality. 
Texturing can take much time, but it is not the most important in the exercise, so consider how much time you spend on this.

% TODO: Taken from the original task description
Based on what is covered in Module 1 and 2 shall be used to model your vehicle as you outlined in Module 0 Exercise 1 Sketch. 
You must model with a view to future use so vehicle propulsion (wheels, belts, bone, etc.) can be animated at a later date. 
The same applies to the vehicle's opportunities for course change / control.
---
That all submissions should have roughly the same size ratio between the different vehicles and for subsequent scaling in such XNA / C\#, 
go into the menu "Customize-> Units Setup" and select the "System Units Setup." 
Here you select the "1Unit = Centimeter" (press ok). 
Secondly, select the "Display Unit Scale" should be Metric and set to Centimeters. 
"Lighting Units" may be International.
---
Then draw a box with dimensions (xyz) 200,200,100 located in coordinates (XYZ) 0,0,0. 
This should be maximum (bounding box) for your model. The box is only to give the impression of how big your model like that about to be. 
The box allows you to hide (hide) and remove when needed.

% TODO: Taken from the original task description
Based on what is covered in Module 1 and 2 and 3 shall be used to model "race cart / vehicle trail" with trbiune and facilities to your vehicle that you modeled in 
"Module 2 Exercise 4 Vehicles".
---
You must model considering scaling the vehicle. 
If you use the same Unit setup as outlined in rehearsal "Module 2 Exercise 4 Vehicles", but changes the Display Units Scale to "Meters", 
then draw a box located to the (xyz) 0,0,0 with size 150m, 150m, 30m has a region that restricts "bounding box for the environment.
---
The box is only to give the impression of how big your model like that about to be. 
The box allows you to hide (hide) and remove when needed. 
Insert your vehicle onto the "path" after you have modeled the finished

Based on what is undergone in module 1..4 you should model a lavpolygon character (Avatar) by yourself. 
You assumes a tutor who came in an earlier version of 3dsmax, but we will turn the focus away from modulate a "Soldier" and using instead pictures of yourself 
to modeled one LowPoly model yourself after the existing this tutor. 
The tutor can be found by downloading tutorfiler from version 9sp2 of 3DSMax located at this link: \url{http://fagweb.hin.no/axs/kilder/3dsmax_t.chm}. 
REMEMBER, that after you have downloaded it you must right-click the file, select properties for the file and choose "unblock" or you will not see its contents. 
Once that's done, open the file and navigate to "Modelling" -> "Modeling a Low-Poly Character". 
Get help from someone to take pictures of yourself from the front and from the side. 
Make sure you do not go crazy when it comes to polygons, you should in turn right shape and animate it as a helper for the vehicle in the path you created in previous exercises. 
Use the same scale as the one you used to model vehicle. 
The avatar must fit the size of the vehicle.

% TODO: Taken from the original task description
Based on what is undergone in module 1..5 should you rig your avatar from previous practice with a skeleton. 
Please note that there is no talk of a biped here. 
You must use the "bones" and then the modifier "skin" after which you need to adjust "envelope" of the individual members / bones 
so that the skeleton motion moving the right parts of the figure. 
Add arm and fotrigger (as shown at the end of chapter 23 in the book) and Inverse Kinematics (IK) that you can use in animation.

Based on what is undergone in module 1..6 light the composite path, vehicle and character in a mood corresponding "evening sun" (see the book chapter 25). 
Rendering must function without error messages. This is an exercise in using bright spots. 
You should not take advantage of "Daylight System"
