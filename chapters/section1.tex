\label{sec:introduction}
The following document contains a summary of all the development projects I have been a part of, starting from my \getprefix{bach}s degree until my completed 
\getprefix{master}s degree in Applied Computer Science. 
Each section is dedicated to a "main" programming language, but more than one may have been used in the development. 
\vspace{0.5em}\newline	
To ensure that projects covering more than one \getprefix{ide} or \getprefix{progLang} is covered, the last page contains an Index listing these.
Projects uploaded to GitHub will also contain a link to its given repository, but group projects are not available on my GitHub account.

Some projects have been pre-described tasks/assignments from the professor of that given course, so some descriptions may seem a bit "artificial". 
This is because I have re-used the original assignment descriptions in some sections to make it more descriptive. 
Projects developed within a specific course will include '\getprefix{college}', '\getprefix{level}' (\getprefix{bach} or \getprefix{master}) and the belonging '\getprefix{course}'.
